# Pygame Animation Projects

This repository contains two simple animation projects using Pygame: `link_animation` and `mario_animation`. Both projects showcase animations based on spritesheets, created using the Pygame library in Python.

## link_animation

The `link_animation` project features an animation of the character Link in a Pygame environment. The animation is rendered using a spritesheet containing different frames of the character's animation.

### How to Run

Make sure to have Pygame installed before running the project. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```
## link_animation
The link_animation project features an animation of the character Link in a Pygame environment. The animation is rendered using a spritesheet containing different frames of the character's animation.

## mario_animation
The mario_animation project is similar to link_animation and features an animation of the character Mario. Likewise, the animation is created using a spritesheet containing frames of the character's animation.

> (Disclamer: all of this is just an experimental project, none of these arts were made by me, so please give the credits to 
TioZacDasGalaxias for making the link's sprites)
